# TypeScript + Nuxt + Tauri template
*NOTE: This template uses yarn. If you do not have yarn installed, run `npm install -g yarn` in your command prompt or terminal.*

You may change whatever you want in this template to fit your needs for your app. Good luck!

## Setup

To use this, use this template or clone the repository and open with your editor.
You will need to have Rust installed. If you do not have it install, visit https://www.rust-lang.org/ to install it.

Install all the dependencies by doing `yarn install`. If you wish to add more dependencies, use `yarn add <package>`.

## Running
Running the program is very simple, just run `yarn tauri dev` and it'll be running. If you are not familiar with Nuxt or Tauri, take a look at their documentation.
